## About
This is a library to calculate the TWAP (time-weighted average price) for uniswap V3 pools. May be extended in the future to support V4 as well.

## Installation

### Install dependencies
```bash
$ make install
```

## Usage
Before running any commands, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# network configs
RPC_LOCALHOST="http://127.0.0.1:8545"

# ethereum nework
RPC_TEST=<rpc url>
RPC_MAIN=<rpc url>
ETHERSCAN_KEY=<api key>

```

Update chain ids in the `HelperConfig.s.sol` file for the chain you want to configure:

- Ethereum: 1 | Sepolia: 11155111 
- Base: 8453 | Base sepolia: 84532
- Bsc: 56 | Bsc Testnet: 97

### Run tests
